    <p>
        Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
        Git relies on the basis of distributed development of software where more than one developer may have access to the source code of a specific application and can modify changes to it that may be seen by other developers..
        Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005.
        Every git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.
        Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. And it helps the team cope with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.</p>
